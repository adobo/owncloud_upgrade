ownCloud upgrade scripts
========================

The scripts on this repository can be used to assist an ownCloud upgrade.

They just extract some information from ownCloud that can be used to
restore the old state on a clean database.

Read the article [Upgrading a large ownCloud instance](http://jorgelp.com/2015/06/upgrading-a-large-owncloud-instance/) to know when to use them.
